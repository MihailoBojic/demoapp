                "description": "Join us for an unforgettable sightseeing boat tour from the charming townlet of Virpazar, nestled right within the heart of Lake Skadar. Explore the stunning beauty of this magnificent lake and visit the medieval Kom Monastery. Set sail on a traditional wooden boat known as čun, and let your guide reveal the hidden gems of the region. Indulge in delicious local wine and take in the breathtaking scenery. Come and join us for an adventure of a lifetime! Experience the breathtaking sight of Vranjina's two majestic peaks as you sail through a narrow river canal. Admire Lesendro, the Key of Lake Skadar, an 18th-century structure where birds often perch atop the ruins. Discover the hidden beauty of three islands adorned with thousands of water lilies next, just before arriving at the medieval monastery Kom. Perched atop Odrin Hill, this hidden gem is accessible only by boat and is home to the best-preserved frescoes in the area. Immerse yourself in the sweet aroma of wild thyme during your 30-minute visit. Finally, enjoy a refreshing swim in the pristine waters of Lake Skadar, and take in the picturesque views of the untouched nature that surrounds you on the way back.",
